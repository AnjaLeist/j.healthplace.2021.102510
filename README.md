Data availability:
Respondent-level variables were obtained from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). The NSHAP is a longitudinal panel study of a representative sample of older Americans employing a complex multi-stage area probability sampling strategy and focusing on health, well-being, and interpersonal relationships. Wave 2 and wave 3 census tract-level data were obtained from the 2006–2010 and 2011–2015 American Community Surveys (ACS), respectively. For both waves, data over five years were averaged because individual years included too few respondents per census tract, and each census tract was studied across all five years. Data were made available by the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research, Ann Arbor, MI.
